## Brief description

Example publish / subscribe, video player observer. The harness allows you to switch sources and observe how the Media Element receives events based on stream status over time.

N.B. You can test stream fails by running the Bunny trailer in Chrome, provided you have just a vanilla install and no additional codecs.
